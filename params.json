{"name":"K2","tagline":"Modern Safe And Simple Crypto","body":"### Welcome to the K2 Crypto Library project.\r\nDoing cryptography is easy.  Doing cryptography right is hard. Mistakes in choice of padding, mode, HAMACs and order of cryptographic primitives often have profound impacts on the underlying security properties one is trying to achieve. The K2 library will make it hard to make mistakes, and easy to inspect the code to see what exactly is being done.\r\n\r\n### What is the state of the project\r\nDesign documents and dreams.\r\n\r\n### What should I use instead\r\n[KeyCzar](http://keyczar.org) is a very good library that make is easy to do crypto well.\r\n\r\n### What's wrong with KeyCzar?\r\nSee the [K2 wiki](https://github.com/google/K2/wiki) for the reasons for why we felt we needed to start from scratch and replace KeyCzar with K2.\r\n\r\n### How can I help?\r\nContact atgs@google.com and we'll gladly find interesting and useful things for you to help out with.
